for open and read functions

```python
>>> f=open("test.txt")
>>> f.read()
'Test\nTest'
```

for reading a file line by line

```python
>>> f=open("test.txt")

>>> for line in fileLines:
...     print(line)
...
Test

for reading reading words in a string with split function. By default, split uses spaces to split the string

```python
>>> introString = "this is an extremely long string that has a lot of words in it, such as this word and the next"
>>> words = introString.split()
>>> print(words)
['this', 'is', 'an', 'extremely', 'long', 'string', 'that', 'has', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'words', 'in', 'it,', 'such', 'as', 'this', 'word', 'and', 'the', 'next']
```

to split items using a separator, do as follows

```python
>>> introString = "this is an extremely, long string that has a lot of words in it, such as this word and the next"
>>> words = introString.split(",")
>>> print(words)
['this is an extremely', ' long string that has a lot of words in it', ' such as this word and the next']
```

to define a function, do as follows

```python
>>> def greet(name):
...     print("Hello, " + name + ". How are you today?")
...
>>> greet("Shivam")
Hello, Shivam. How are you today?
```
